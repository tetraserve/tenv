# OpenDAX

OpenDAX is an open-source cloud-native multi-service platform for building a Blockchain/FinTech exchange of digital assets, cryptocurrency and security tokens.

## Getting started with OpenDAX

### 1. Get a VM

Minimum VM requirements for OpenDAX:
 * 8GB of RAM (12GB recommended)
 * 4 cores vCPU (6 cores recommended)
 * 300GB disk space (SSD recommended)

A VM from any cloud provider like DigitalOcean, Vultr, GCP, AWS as well as any dedicated server with Ubuntu, Debian or Centos would work

### 2. Prepare the VM

#### 2.1 Create Unix user
SSH using root user, then create new user for the application
```bash
useradd -g users -s `which bash` -m app
```

#### 2.2 Install Docker and docker compose

We highly recommend using docker and compose from docker.com install guide instead of the system provided package, which would most likely be deprecated.

Docker follow instruction here: [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
Docker compose follow steps: [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### 2.3 Install ruby in user app

##### 2.3.1 Change user using
```bash
su - app
```

##### 2.3.2 Clone OpenDAX
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openware/opendax.git
```

##### 2.3.3 Install RVM
```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
cd opendax
rvm install .
```

### 3. Bundle install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
rake -T # To see if ruby and lib works
```

Using `rake -T` you can see all available commands, and can create new ones in `lib/tasks`


### 4. Run everything

#### 4.1 Configure your domain
If using a VM you can point your domain name to the VM ip address before this stage.
Recommended if you enabled SSL, for local development edit the `/etc/hosts`


Insert in file `/etc/hosts`
```
0.0.0.0 www.app.local
```

#### 4.2 Bring everything up

```bash
rake service:all
```


You can login on `www.app.local` with the following default users from seeds.yaml
```
Seeded users:
Email: admin@barong.io, password: 0lDHd9ufs9t@
Email: john@barong.io, password: Am8icnzEI3d!
```

## Usage

### Initial configuration

All the OpenDAX deployment files have their confguration stored in `config/app.yml`.

Feel free to fill it out with correct values:

| Parameter         | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `app.name`        | Global application name                          |
| `app.domain`      | Base domain name to be used                      |
| `ssl.enabled`     | Enable SSL certificate generation                |
| `ssl.email`       | Email address to use for SSL generation requests |
| `images`          | Application images tags                          |
| `vendor`          | Frontend application Git repo URL                |
| `render_protect`  | Enable read-only mode for rendered files         |

    Note: You can protect all the rendered files from being edited so that you wouldn't lose your changes upon re-rendering templates in the future by setting `render_protect` to `true` 
Once you're done with the configuration, render the files using `rake render:config`. You can easily apply your changes at any time by running this command.

    Note: be sure to append all the subdomains based on app.domain to your
    /etc/hosts file if you're running OpenDax locally

### Bringing up the stack

The OpenDAX stack can be brought up using two ways:

1. Bootstrap all the components at once using `rake service:all[start]`
2. Start every component one-by-one using `rake service:*component*[start]`

The components included in the stack are:

- `proxy` - [Traefik](https://traefik.io/), a robust cloud-native edge router/reverse proxy written in Go
- `backend` - [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), [Redis](https://redis.io) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) grouped together
- `cryptonodes` - cryptocurrency nodes such as [parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum) **[Optional]**
- `daemons` - Peatio and Ranger daemons **[Optional]**
- `setup` - setup hooks for Peatio and Barong to run before the application starts (DB migration etc.)
- `app` - [Peatio](https://github.com/rubykube/peatio), [Barong](https://github.com/rubykube/barong) and the [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io) API gateway
- `frontend` - the frontend application located at `vendor/frontend`
- `tower` - the Tower admin panel application located at `vendor/tower`
- `monitoring` - [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) and [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) monitoring tools **[Optional]**

For example, to start the `backend` services, you'll simply need to run `rake service:backend[start]`

    Note: all the components marked as [Optional] need to be installed using
    rake service:*component*[start] explicitly

Go ahead and try your own OpenDAX exchange deployment!

### Vault setup

You can run Vault in two modes: `development` and `production`. You can set it in the `vault.mode` field of `app.yml`.
The main differences are:
 - Development mode
   Everything is stored in memory, thus all API keys and 2FA tokens are lost on every container restart.
 - Production mode
   Everything is persisted on the local filesystem, thus API keys and 2FA tokens are preserved between restarts. However, Vault needs to be unsealed after every stop/restart.

To setup Vault in production mode, go through the following steps:
  - `docker-compose exec vault sh`
  - `vault operator init`
  - Save the output to a file in a secure place
  - Unlock Vault with three different unlock keys - `vault operator unseal *unseal_key*`
  - `vault login *root_token*`
  - `vault secrets enable totp`
  - `vault secrets disable secret`
  - `vault secrets enable -path=secret -version=1 kv`

Add the Vault root token to `config/app.yml`, render the configs and start the `app` services.
Afterwards, Vault should be fully configured and ready to work with Peatio and Barong.

For development mode Vault setup you don't have to perform any actions.

### Stopping and restarting components

Any component from the stack can be easily stopped or restarted using `rake service:*component*[stop]` and `rake service:*component*[restart]`.

For example, `rake service:frontend[stop]` would stop the frontend application container and `rake service:proxy[restart]` would completely restart the reverse proxy container.

# Managing component deployments

Each component has a config file (ex. `config/frontend/tower.js`) and a compose file (ex. `compose/frontend.yaml`).

All config files are mounted into respective component container, except from `config/app.yml` - this file contains all the neccessary configuration of opendax deployment

Compose files contain component images, environment configuration etc.

These files get rendered from their respective templates that are located under `templates` directory.

## How to update component image?

Modify `config/app.yml` with correct image and run `rake service:all`
This will rerender all the files from `templates` directory and restart all the running services.

Alternitavely you can update the following files:
  * `config/app.yml`
  * `templates/compose/*component*.yml`
  * `compose/*component*.yml`
And run `rake service:component[start]`

## How to update component config?

Modify `config/*component*/*config*` and run `rake service:component[start]`,
if you want the changes to be persistent, you also need to update `templates/config/*components*/*config*`

#### Render compose file
```
# Delete all generated files
git clean -fdx

# Re-generate config from config/app.yml values
rake render:config

# Restart the container you need to reload config
docker-compose up frontend -Vd
```

#### Clone the vendors and start
```
source ./bin/set-env.sh
rake vendor:clone
docker-compose -f compose/vendor.yaml up -d
```

## Terraform Infrastructure as Code Provisioning

You can easily deploy OpenDAX from scratch on Google Cloud Platform using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)!

To do this, just follow these simple steps:
  - Fill `app.yml` with correct values
  - Run `rake terraform:apply`
  - Access your VM from the GCP Cloud Console

To destroy the provisioned infrastructure, just run `rake terraform:destroy`

## Installer tool

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openware/opendax/master/bin/install)"
```
